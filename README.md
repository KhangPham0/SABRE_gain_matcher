# Bayesian Calibration of Double-sided Silicon Strip Detectors

This project implements an energy calibration method for double-sided silicon strip detectors, as described in [M. Reese et. al.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nima.2015.01.032). The method employs Bayesian inference to calculate the set of intrinsic calibration coefficients of a given silicon detector. The workflow involves data extraction, data filtering, slope calculation, calibration coefficient computation, and visualization. Designed specifically for the Super Enge Split-pole Spectrograph and Silicon Array for Branching Ratio Experiments (SESPS + SABRE) experimental setup at Florida State University's John D. Fox accelerator laboratory, it necessitates the sorted and analyzed output files from the [SPS-SABRE EventBuilder](https://github.com/sesps/SPS_SABRE_EventBuilder).

## Dependencies

This program is built with:

+ **GNU Make 4.3** for managing the build process.
+ **C++ compiler with C++17 support**  (GCC 7.0 and above, or equivalent) for compiling the source code.
+ **ROOT (version 6.26/10)** for handling data analysis and visualization.
+ **OpenMP**  for enabling parallel processing.

## Installation

First, clone the GitHub repository:

`git clone https://github.com/KhangPham0/SABRE_gain_matcher.git`

Navigate to the project directory:

`cd SABRE_gain_matcher`

Compile the program and generate the shared library with the provided makefile:

`make`

This command will also create all necessary directories, compile all source files, generate ROOT dictionaries, and build a shared library.

## Usage

Once the program is successfully built, you can calibrate the detectors individually or all at once using one of the provided bash scripts.

### Individual Calibration

You can run the calibration for individual detectors using the following command:

`./bin/gainMatch <run_number> <config_file>`

Where:

+ `<run_number>` is an integer representing the run number of the input file you want to use for to do gain match.
+ `<config_file>` is the name of a configuration file. Example configuration files named `det#_config.txt` (where `#` can go from 0 to 4) are already provided in the repo.

For example, to run the program with run number 83 and configuration file `det0_config.txt`, use:

`./bin/gainMatch 83 det0_config.txt`

The program will load the required shared library, process the input arguments and the configuration file, extract and filter necessary data from the specified source, calculate slopes of the filtered data using Bayesian inference, calculate calibration coefficients using chi-square minimization, and generate and save plots of the results in the `outputs` directory.

This is useful if you want to recalibrate a single detector or if you want to manually control the calibration process.

### Running the Concurrent Calibration Script (Linux Only)

For convenience, you can calibrate all five detectors concurrently with a single command using a bash script. **Please note that this script currently only supports Linux systems due to its reliance on `gnome-terminal` for concurrent executions. Please ensure `gnome-terminal` is available on your Linux machine.**


To calibrate all detectors concurrently on a Linux system, use the following command:

`./gainMatchAllDetectorsConcurrently.sh <run_number>`

Where:

+ `<run_number>` is an integer representing the run number of the input files you want to use for gain matching.

This script will open separate terminals (using `gnome-terminal`) and run the calibration for each detector concurrently. It creates temporary files (`/tmp/det#_done` where `#` goes from 0 to 4) to keep track of the status of each calibration process. Once all calibrations are done, it will automatically run the ROOT macro `combineGainMaps.C` to combine the gain files.

Please note that this concurrent script may occasionally exhibit bug-like behavior during the plotting process. If such issues arise, consider using the individual calibration method or the sequential calibration script.

### Running the Sequential Calibration Script

If you prefer running each calibration sequentially to avoid possible issues during the plotting process, you can use the sequential calibration script:

`./gainMatchAllDetectorsSequentially.sh <run_number>`

Where:

+ `<run_number>` is an integer representing the run number of the input files you want to use for gain matching.

This script will run the calibration process for each detector sequentially, one after the other. It prints the status of each calibration process and informs you when each detector is done. Once all detectors have been calibrated, it will automatically run the ROOT macro `combineGainMaps.C` to combine the gain files.

Remember that all these scripts assume that the configuration files named `det#_config.txt` (where `#` can go from 0 to 4) are already provided in the repo and that the "eventbuild" root files are located inside the `inputs` directory and follow the naming format `run_#` where `#` is an integer.

## Configuration Files

Please note that the example configuration files assume that the "eventbuild" root files are located inside the `inputs` directory and follow the naming format `run_#.root` where `#` is an integer. If you create your own configuration files, they should specify details such as the input directory, detector ID, channel map file, and other relevant parameters.

## Cleaning up

To clean up the generated files and start fresh, run:

`make clean`

This command will remove the compiled binaries, object files, shared library, and the ROOT dictionaries generated during the build process.
